What is a branch in GitHub? You can consider a branch as your own 'working copy' of the code. What is a pull request? In simple words, pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to tell that their feature is compelete and can be merged with rest of the existing code. How to raise a PR. Clone the project. Create a new branch (In case using cli use git checkout -b yourbranchname) Add a new file with your github username or a custom code of your own! Git Add and commit the changes.(Incase using CLI : git add and git commit -m commitmessage) Push the code! (Yay! Your first commit. Push using git push origin yourbranchname) On the github go to a branch and create a PR using the button there! I would recommend using github desktop for committing your code if you are a beginner but if you want to learn cli/gitbash there are commands in the steps.
